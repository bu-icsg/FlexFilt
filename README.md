# FlexFilt
Flexible Instruction Filtering for Security.

Note: FlexFilt will be officially released soon. This document is provided for ACSAC artifact evaluation.

## Overview
In this document, we provide a guideline for running experiments on FlexFilt. For more details on FlexFilt please refer to our paper.
We run our experiments on the Xilinx Zynq Zedboard FPGA and use a modified Linux kernel 4.15 to provide the support for our hardware.
You can find the source code for our test programs in the code folder.
The evaluation folder includes the binaries for running the tests on the baseline and FlexFilt configurations.
For detailed information about our test programs, please refer to the [new_code](https://github.com/bu-icsg/FlexFilt/tree/new_code) branch.
The new_code branch also provides detailed comments on each test program.
